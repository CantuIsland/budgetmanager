# budgetmanager
This applications allows the user to manage their budget.

The user will first have to enter their total income. They can update this number at any moment. Once the income is accounted for, 
they will begin to enter their expenses. Expenses will be seperated into sections to keep them organized. These sections will include
rent/mortgage, utility bills(water, electricity, gas), groceries, car payment, and entertainment(movies, parks, bowling, etc.). Not
all of these sections need to be filled, but if any of these sections are used, that number will be subtracted from the total income. 
You will then have a total at the bottom that tells you how much you have left after all of the expenses. This total can be moved into a
savings section.
